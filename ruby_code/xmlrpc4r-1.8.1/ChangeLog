* fixed bug for mswin32 Ruby (signal HUP). Submitted by Martin Stannard.

:1.7.6 (2001-11-02)

* fixed bug in StreamParserMixin (NQXMLStreamParser and XMLStreamParser):
  <boolean>0</boolean> resulted in "" instead of false (found by covert
  thaddeus).

:1.7.5 (2001-10-30)

* fixed bug in XMLParser::XMLStreamParser (found by covert thaddeus).

:1.7.4 (2001-10-22)

  XMLRPC::FaultException a Hash was returned for the "fault" tag. 
  Added to the testcases.

:1.7.2 (2001-08-01)

:1.7.1 (2001-07-27)
* NQXMLStreamParser is now the default parser
* added NQXMLStreamParser (slightly faster than NQXMLTreeParser, but
  scales a bit better for larger documents)
* Base64: remove whitespaces

:1.7 (2001-07-26)
* added XMLStreamParser; on the average 20 times faster than NQXMLParser and
  still about twice as fast as XMLParser (DOM). 
  XMLStreamParser scales well for large XML documents (e.g. 0.5 MB in size), so is it
  ~350 (!) times faster than NQXMLParser and still ~18 times faster than
  XMLParser.

:1.6.9 (2001-07-19)
* added redist/ directory (TCPSocketPipe.rb, application.rb and dump.rb)
* now NQXML is the default parser
* improved HttpServer (used for standalone server)

:1.6.8 (2001-07-06)
* added server-side support for mod_ruby (XMLRPC::ModRubyServer)
* added Service::PublicInstanceMethodsInterface, or short form with method XMLRPC::iPIMethods, which 
  allows to add all instance methods of a class as handlers to a server 
* added Service::Interface class (or method XMLRPC::interface) and a third
  form of BasicServer#add_handler(interface, obj)

:1.6.7 (2001-07-02)
* Client: added two new constructors: 
  * Client.new2(uri, proxy=nil, timeout=nil)
  * Client.new3(hash={})
* Client: added read-timeout (method timeout/timeout=)
* Client: added asynchronous methods: call_async, call2_async, multicall_async, mutlicall2_async, proxy_async, proxy2_async
* Client: if user/password specified sends every time a Authorization header (Basic), do not check WWW-Authentificate header. 
* includes new version of GServer.rb which fixed two minor logging-misbehaviours

:1.6.6 (2001-06-25)
* added Client-interface wrapper for SandStorm component architecture (see SourceForge.net).
  See file samples/sandstorm/active.rb
* added Basic HTTP (401) Authorization to Client and support for SSL.
    Client#new(host, url, port, proxy_host, proxy_port, user, password, use_ssl)
  For SSL you need the SSL package from RAA. 
* added full support for Introspection (only proc-handlers are supported)
* instance variables which value is  nil are not marshalled unless ENABLE_NIL_CREATE is true
* Marshallable classes need not have method initialize without arguments (adapted from SOAP4R)
* changed config.rb (made it simpler)
* added two flags ENABLE_MULTICALL and ENABLE_INTROSPECTION to config.rb

:1.6.5 (2001-06-21)
* modified multicall/multicall2 return value [1,2,3] instead of [[1], [2], [3]]
* CGIServer works now with FastCGI (see samples/xml.fcgi)
* renamed Server#stop to Server#shutdown
* added XMLRPC::Marshallable, to marshall any Ruby object to a hash and
  restore the object later from that hash.
* fixed bug where <value>  </value> was stripped to ""

:1.6.4 (2001-06-19)
* clients can use Symbol as type which is converted to a String
* added <nil/> (optionally) as well as BigInt (Bignum's > 32 bits)
* added configuration file (config.rb) for changing globally the parser/writer
  to use as well as which features to enable

:1.6.3 (2001-06-12)
* fixed default_handler bug
* added system.multicall extension
* added parser test-cases
* fixed bug: <value></value> was invalid (found by Thaddeus Covert)
* added Introspection (BasicServer#add_introspection) (by Neil Conway)
* added service-hook (which is called for each RPC)

:1.6.2 (2001-06-03)
* fixed bug; in create.rb XMLWrite::Simple did not escape text, thanx to Colin Steele
* a XMLRPC::Base64 object is no longer returned from a RPC, instead a Ruby String is returned.

:1.6.1
* changed HOWTO (added information on how to use NQXML)
* NQXML parser support
* possibility to choose between different XML parsers and XML writers, with
  Client#set_parser/#set_writer and BasicServer#set_parser/#set_writer
* added HTTP.version_1_1, so now works with Ruby versions > 1.7
* now you can do XML-RPC calls through a proxy server (Client.new).
  Thanks to Hiroshi.

:1.6
* added RAA (Ruby Application Archive) XML-RPC example TkRAA
* added XMLRPC::Client#proxy and #proxy2 as well as subclass Client::Proxy
* fixed another empty string bug, which occured when an empty name-tag (hash-key) was used.

: 1.5.4

* added Struct as possible type in a XMLRPC::Client#call/call2 or as a return value from a server-handler.

: 1.5.1
* now works also with Windows (validates)
* standalone-server (XMLRPC::Server) works correctly (changed \n to \r\n), and validates
* XMLRPC::Server.new has now a second paramter "host" to specify the host to listen on

: 1.5
* allow BigNum's that fit in 32-bit
* now, always check the parity of a method before calling it
* in server.rb, BasicServer#set/get_argument_error_handler removed
* in server.rb, BasicServer.new removed argument "check_parity", now always on
* introduced new type XMLRPC::DateTime to handle times which
  year is before 1970 (DateTime is now always returned, no more Date/Time)
* xmlrpc4r now validates to the validator1 test-suite
* added validator sample
* fixed a bug in parser, which causes the validator-suite to fail
* started writing ChangeLog
