ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
===============

John W. Small (jsmall@laser.net):
  * I included his ruby-generic-server into this package and use it
    as a base for the Standalone XML-RPC server. 
    For copyright notice and license, see file "redist/GServer.rb". 
    It is available from RAA.

NAKAMURA Hiroshi (NaHi):
  * Many thanks to him, author of SOAP4R, for idea of marshalling Ruby 
    objects and it's implementation.
    Helped to find several bugs.  
  * included his TCPSocketPipe.rb and application.rb (see redist/), as
    well as the modified monitor.rb in samples/monitor.

Neil Conway:
  Inspired and helped implementing Introspection support

PREREQUISITES
=============
- One of the following XML parser:
  * NQXML (tested with 0.6.1, 1.0.3 and 1.1.1) 
  * XMLParser (tested with 0.6.1 and 0.6.2) 
  * REXML (tested with 2.3.5) 
  * xmlscan (tested with 0.2.1)
- Ruby >= 1.6

Note that you have to edit the config.rb file in directory lib/ if you 
want to change the used parser (default is now (since 1.6.9) NQXMLParser).

TEST
=====
If you want, you can execute the testcases, to make sure, 
all (for which testcases exist) works correctly.
Therefore you need "RUNIT" from RAA installed.
Then go into directory "test" (you have to go into 
this directory, otherwise it will not work!!!), 
and run "ruby test.rb". If in the last line there's an
"OK", all works as expected.

INSTALL
=======

Edit the lib/config.rb file to configure which XML parser/writer
to use or which features to enable. 

Type "ruby install.rb" in current directory.
Make sure you have root priviledges before you do this.

The XML-RPC library files are installed in your site_ruby directory,
of the actual ruby-version (e.g. "site_ruby/1.6") under the 
directory "xmlrpc".
All files in directory redist/ are copied to "site_ruby/1.6".

DOCUMENTATION
=============
Open doc/index.html in a web-browser.


SAMPLES
=======
See samples/validator/validator1.rb for a very good example.
I've also included one example of an XML-RPC cgi-based server and
a ruby-program which calles it.
"samples/xml.cgi" is the cgi-based server, which should be placed
into your cgi-bin directory of your web-server.
"sampels/call.rb" is the client-side which calls the server (check 
the URL /cgi-bin/xml.cgi in samples/call.rb if it points to the cgi-based
server-script)

PROBLEMS
========
A problem is that XML-RPC do not specify the timezone. 
I use Time.gm(...) to create a Time object!
